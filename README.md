# Coding_Two_Final-project

For my final project, I'm trying to extend my second python assignment and I was really interested in weeks 6 and 8d, using tensorflow to make images transform between different styles, which was very interesting.

So I learned the code and how to use it on the tensorflow website, created my own style conversion and GAN output and tried to get it to work on more images.

For level reasons, this is the best I can do at the moment.
